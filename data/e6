Whatever is worth doing is worth doing well.
Happiness is a way station between too much and too little.
In love folly is always sweet.
The hard part isn’t making the decision. 
It’s living with it.
Your happy passer-by all knows, my distressed there is no place hides.
You may be out of my sight, but never out of my mind.
Love is not a maybe thing.
You know when you love someone.
In the end, it’s not the years in your life that count. 
It’s the life in your years.
When the whole world is about to rain, let’s make it clear in our heart together.
It’s better to be alone than to be with someone you’re not happy to be with.
Life is a journey, not the destination, but the scenery along the should be and the mood at the view.
Time goes by so fast, people go in and out of your life.
You must never miss the opportunity to tell these people how much they mean to you.
I lied when I said I didn’t like you. 
I lied when I said I didn’t care. 
I lie every time I try to tell myself I will never fall for you.
